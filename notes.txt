=============lec 1============

- basic cpp 
- #include <bits/stdc++.h> 

.........vector.....

- Vectors - push_back,emplace_back || emplace_back vs push_back
- for(auto x : vector)
- lower_bound and upper_bound , bi search , ex to be done
- to find index subract pointer from pointer. 
	ex: int index = upper_bound(v.begin(),v.end(),4) - v.begin(); 

......list........

- collections in cpp and difference between them

......pair.........

- sorting in pair using comparator
- more like table with only two columns

......tuple.....

- more like table with many columns

........structure.........

........set and multiset....

- set are internally bi search tree, performs all opr in logn

........map.......

- implement red-black tree
- performs all opr in logn
- preserves order of data

....unorderedmap.....

- does not preserves order of data
- faster than map.

.......dequeque........

- question

.....priority_queue.......

- sorting on priority_queue

......graphs....

- create graph in c++
- pegion hole principle , know more about graphs.

----------Number Th.-------------

- pascals triangle - application of nCr

|1|
|1|1|
|1|2|1| -> sum of upper indexes -> indexes either 0 or last should be one.
|1|3|3|1| -> 
	
...........seive of erathmus............

- find no. of divisors using seive of erathmus -> increase count for when a element is encountered
- find sum of divisors of no. -> instead of updating with 1 sum add all j's
- do prime factorisation -> save the smallest divisor in elmt.	
- factorisation using normal approach
-       ""      of all numbers using SOE -> save LL on each element-> LL contains all prime which divides it.

...........GCD using euclid's algo...........


...........Euler totiant funciton........
- formula for no. of coprime num less than n; 
- for n


-------uber quetions-------

- in graph, edges are there only between two coprime no. -> could be done using disjoint set.
- array, remove an element and half it, store it in a way that sum of array lesser then the earlier -> done using priority queue 


...........fermets theorem.........

- pow(a,b)

..........inverse of a number.........

- mod of very big number.
- get number divisible by two numbers;


.........inclusion/exclusion..........
- formulas for exlusion and inclusion

-----------Tip------------------
use small identifiers.
go to hackerrank for questions
do contests on codeforces and other coding platforms, codeforces-> start doing div 3 que.
go through with all topics of ds.
